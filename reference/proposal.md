# Medtronic Proposal Outline

# Prequel - JAMA Cardiology Paper https://click.endnote.com/viewer?doi=10.1001%2Fjamacardio.2021.3702&token=WzI1OTg4MSwiMTAuMTAwMS9qYW1hY2FyZGlvLjIwMjEuMzcwMiJd.FzRXlWpt6q1BShzTdk2UrefCnmE
Review the figure in paper as a model - it presents odds ratio of stroke depending on which window of days patient had AF
An analogue for this paper would be a major atrial event (new onset AF) or ventricular event (VT/VF/death?) as the outcome (instead of stroke) and psych billing exposure (new diagnosis, new drug, or hospitalization) on x axis, divided by days, weeks, or months.

## Introduction

### Relationship between arrhythmia burden and neurocardiac disturbances  

1. Arrhythmia burden is an additional feature on spectrum of heart disease
1. Both supraventricular and ventricular ectopy/tachycardia are markers of symptom burden
1. VT/SVT may be thresholds for ANS dysfunction, particularly in patients with ANS dz (e.g. depression, PTSD)
1. Identifying if neurocardiac changes, like treating psych disorders, a/w decreased arrhythmia burden

### Objectives of Medtronic/Optum database proposal

1. Identify relationship between psych and arrhythmia burden
1. Identify if dose-response curve is present 
1. Evaluate risk between treated and untreated psychiatric patients in terms of arrhythmia burden
1. Mortality or MACE (particularly arrhythmogenic) differences based on psychiatric burden

### Importance and novelty of research proposal

1. Prior data suggests in small cohorts how arrhythmia burden (e.g. VT) and depression are correlated
1. Mortality data limited, mainly shows inflammatory/plaque rupture, mixed information on arrhythmia and depression
1. Growing evidence that psych/neurocardiac burden (ANS dysfunction) is worse for outcomes
