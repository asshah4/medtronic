# Medtronic Proposal Outline

## Introduction

### Relationship between arrhythmia burden and neurocardiac disturbances  

1. Arrhythmia burden is an additional feature on spectrum of heart disease
1. Both supraventricular and ventricular ectopy/tachycardia are markers of symptom burden
1. VT/SVT may be thresholds for ANS dysfunction, particularly in patients with ANS dz (e.g. depression, PTSD)
1. Identifying if neurocardiac changes, like treating psych disorders, a/w decreased arrhythmia burden

### Objectives of Medtronic/Optum database proposal

1. Identify relationship between psych and arrhythmia burden
1. Identify if dose-response curve is present 
1. Evaluate risk between treated and untreated psychiatric patients in terms of arrhythmia burden
1. Mortality or MACE (particularly arrhythmogenic) differences based on psychiatric burden

### Importance and novelty of research proposal

1. Prior data suggests in small cohorts how arrhythmia burden (e.g. VT) and depression are correlated
1. Mortality data limited, mainly shows inflammatory/plaque rupture, mixed information on arrhythmia and depression
1. Growing evidence that psych/neurocardiac burden (ANS dysfunction) is worse for outcomes
